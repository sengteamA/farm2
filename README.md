Welcome to the Farm Simulator!

## How to load into Eclipse

1. Extract .zip archive to get the "farm" directory.

2. Open Eclipse and create a new empty Java project into a new workspace.
   Use File > New > Java Project.

3. Right click on the source folder (in the Package Explorer view) and
   click Import... > General > File System, then choose the "farm"
   directory that was extracted earlier.

4. The source code will be accessible in the "./src/" subdirectory.
   You can also access the tests, which are in "./tests/", and the
   Javadoc documentation, which is in "./doc/".

This has been tested with Java 11 JDK.

## How to build the source code

1. Building the .jar file can be done with Eclipse: File > Export > Runnable JAR file.

## How to run

1. Ensure Java 11 JDK or above is installed.

2. Extract .zip archive and retrieve the .jar file.

3. Run this command to start the game:
java -jar 33055308_56835905_FarmingSimulator.jar
